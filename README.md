## ADMINISTRATIVE SUBDIVISIONS OF PUERTO RICO

### Puerto Rico is an island and U.S. territory located in the Caribbean Sea in Central America. The political subdivisions of Puerto Rico consist of international borders and 78 different municipalities. Each municipality elects a mayor and legislature to govern and control day to day life in the municipality. I selected the municipality of Caguas, Puerto Rico for my project. Caguas is located on the eastern side of Puerto Rico and shares its northern border with the municipality of San Juan. Caguas also shares its border with the municipalities of Aguas Buenas, Cidra, and Cayey to the west, and San Lorenzo, Gurabo, and Trujillo Alto to the east.
